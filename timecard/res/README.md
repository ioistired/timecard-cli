## kp.ttf

The font used is called "Krabby Patty v1.0". Although the game "Operation Krabby Patty" was owned by THQ (who owns it now?), however, I believe its use to be fair under [U.S. law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107) because (each number below refers to the clauses of that law):

1. I am not using it for commercial purposes.
4. A font is a rather small part of an entire video game, so I believe that its use would not damage the potential market for the video game.

<blockquote>
Krabby Patty is a conversion of the main font as seen on SpongeBob SquarePants. It was made using the graphics from the "Operation Krabby Patty" PC game.

Krabby Patty v1.0

This is meant to be for personal use only, because even though
it's "unofficial" it's basically an exact copy of the font used
in the game. I don't know if there was a license for it, but just
to be safe please don't include this font in anything you're
planning to sell or make money off of (such as games, monetized
YouTube videos, T-shirts, etc.)

Oh, and don't sell this font either.

Thanks.

## timecards/

Source unknown. Needs research as to whether these time card backgrounds are owned by Nickelodeon. Regardless, I believe the use of these time card backgrounds to be fair for the same reasons as the Krabby Patty font.
